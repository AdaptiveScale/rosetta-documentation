Data transfer is the category where users can initiate the transfer of data from a created catalog to a Google Storage Bucket or Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) data source.

## Example

### Start a Data transfer

To start a data transfer, users must select a catalog from which they want to transfer data to a chosen target, which can be either a GCS or S3 bucket. Additionally, users need to specify the path where this transfer will be located.

This functionality streamlines the process of moving data between catalogs and external storage services, facilitating efficient data management within the Rosetta platform.
